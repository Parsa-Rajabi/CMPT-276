## Policy on the Use of AI Content Generators for the Coursework.

As Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) gains traction, its impact on post-secondary education is increasingly being debated. Some argue that it will make education more accessible, while others worry about its potential to replace human teachers. In this course policy, I will outline how we will tackle this challenge in CMPT 276 - Intro to Software Engineernig. Please note that this policy only applies to CMPT 276, section D300 (Fall 2023).

In a nutshell, the use of AI tools is permitted for all course content including assignments, labs and project work except exams. Using tools such as ChatGPT will not be allowed during in-person quizzes and midterm exam. As part of the course policy, students are required to disclose any use of AI tools for each assignment, lab and project submission. Failure to follow this policy will be considered a violation of SFU's academic policy.

## I view AI tools as a powerful resource that you can learn to embrace.

The goal is to develop your resilience to automation, as these tools will become increasingly prevalent in the future. By incorporating these tools into your work process, you will be able to focus on skills that will remain relevant despite the rise of automation. Furthermore, I believe that these tools can be beneficial for students that consider English as their second and those who have been disadvantaged, allowing them to express their ideas in a more articulate and efficient manner.

## We are aware that there are risks involved in allowing the use of AI tools in your assignment/lab/project deliverables.

Therefore, we ask that you read this carefully and use the tools responsibly. 

Firstly, it is important to note that AI tools are susceptible to errors and may incorporate discriminatory ideas in their output. As a student, **it is your responsibility to ensure the quality and appropriateness of the work you submit in this course**.

Secondly, please be mindful of the data you provide to these systems, as your assignments, labs, projects may contain private information, not just your own but also that of others. For example, you should never enter the names of your project team members into ChatGPT. 

Thirdly, there is a **risk of inadvertently plagiarizing** when using these tools. Many AI chatbots and image generators create content based on existing bodies of work without proper citation. In addition, other students may use these tools to generate content that is similar to yours. Therefore, it is important to **cite your sources** and **use the tools responsibly**. **Our plagiarism policy will apply to all assignment, lab and project submissions, and "AI did it!" will not excuse any plagiarism**. 

Lastly, be aware of the dangers of becoming overly dependent on these tools. While they can be incredibly useful, relying on them too much can diminish your own critical thinking and writing skills.

## For every assignment submission, you are required to complete a form called the "AI use disclosure." 

Submitting this disclosure will help us understand and mitigate the risks associated with the use of AI tools in the course. The form will ask about your use of AI tools for the assignment and the extent to which you used them. You will be asked to submit the disclosure via Canvas.

## If you do not wish to use these tools, that is a valid decision.

The use of AI tools in education can be messy and unpredictable due to the risks mentioned earlier. Some students may have moral confusion or concerns about the uncertainty associated with using AI tools in their coursework. **If you do not wish to use them, that is a valid decision.** This policy aims to anticipate and mitigate any potential harms associated with AI tool usage, rather than promoting their use.

## We will not mark you down for the use or non-use of AI tools.

Grading will be done based on the rubric on an absolute scale, so students who do not use AI tools will not be at a disadvantage. Also, the use of AI tools will not negatively impact your grade.

**Please note that the policy about the use of AI tools in CMPT 276 - D300 is up for change as the term progresses. Changes will be communicated in-class and via this page.**

Questions about this policy can be directed to the instructor via email with the following email header: _[CMPT 276 - AI Policy]_.
