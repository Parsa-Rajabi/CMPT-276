# Anonymous Feedback Form

Please let me know if you have any comments, thoughts, questions, and feedback about the course or me as an instructor. This form is completely anonymous and no identifiable information will be collected or stored. I hope you will consider this a safe space to provide genuine feedback to your instructor (Parsa Rajabi).

Note that despite the fact that this form is anonymous and I will never find out who you are, I urge you to still be respectful, courteous, and professional. Don't forget, I am human too!
