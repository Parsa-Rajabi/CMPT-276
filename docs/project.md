## Details

**Develop a web application** that integrates two (2) different [APIs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api), with at least three (3) distinct features for each API (a total of six (6) features).

You may choose APIs from a [provided list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) or other sources. It is recommended to select free, well-documented APIs with active user communities.

- An application "`feature`" is defined as:
  > a distinct functionality or component of the application that offers a specific value or service to the user. It should be a **self-contained** unit that, on its own, delivers a portion of the overall application's functionality. In other words, a feature should not rely on other features to function. 

When considering features, prioritize the user's perspective. A valuable feature enhances the user experience, fulfills a user need, or solves a particular problem for the user.

<details>
<summary>Bonus Marks?</summary>
Each semester, the teaching team selects a few standout projects that showcase exceptional effort, creativity, and innovation. In lieu of bonus marks, these projects are honored in the ‚ÄúHall of Fame‚Äù and may have the opportunity to continue as research projects in future semester(s). Research projects usually lead to publications, presentations, and potential collaborations with industry partners.

While the core project requirements are essential, these projects are often well-polished, demonstrate a **strong attention to detail**, and solve **a unique societal problem**. In spirit of the rise of *AI-Education tools*, projects that incorporate AI-based learning platforms, simulations, teaching tools, or research tools will be given special consideration.

<details>
<summary>Milestone 1.5 details (click to expand):</summary>

This project check-in is an opportunity for your group to receive feedback on the progress of your project and ensure that you are on track to complete the project successfully. 

The check-in will be a 15-minute meeting with your assigned TA. As we approach the check-in date, groups will be provided with a sign-up sheet to select a time slot for their meeting (on a first-come, first-serve basis).

To prepare for this check-in, your group should submit a 1-page report that includes the group's progress on the following items:


|         Item          |                          Expected Progress                          |
| :-------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    API 1 features     |           Features should be completed or near completion           |
|    API 2 features     |           Features details should be confirmed and planned           |
| Application Interface |  Interface should be developed and interactive with API 1 features  |
|         CI/CD         |              Pipeline should be set up and configured               |
|  Application Testing  | Automated tests should be set up and configured for API 1 features |


> **All group members are required to attend this check-in. Any member who fails to attend will receive a `10% deduction` from the overall project grade. No exceptions will be made.**

    - It is recommended to have a voiceover explaining the features being demonstrated but not required
    - For future job applications, this video can be used as a portfolio piece (make it professional) 
  - Future work and potential improvements
