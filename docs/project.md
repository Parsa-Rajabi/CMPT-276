## Details

**Develop a web application** that integrates two (2) different [APIs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api), with at least three (3) distinct features for each API (a total of six (6) features).

You may choose APIs from a [provided list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) or other sources. It is recommended to select free, well-documented APIs with active user communities.

- An application "`feature`" is defined as:
  > a distinct functionality or component of the application that offers a specific value or service to the user. It should be a **self-contained** unit that, on its own, delivers a portion of the overall application's functionality. In other words, a feature should not rely on other features to function. 

When considering features, prioritize the user's perspective. A valuable feature enhances the user experience, fulfills a user need, or solves a particular problem for the user.

<summary>Bonus Marks?</summary>
Each semester, the teaching team selects a few standout projects that showcase exceptional effort, creativity, and innovation. In lieu of bonus marks, these projects are honored in the ‚ÄúHall of Fame‚Äù and may have the opportunity to continue as research projects in future semester(s). Research projects usually lead to publications, presentations, and potential collaborations with industry partners.

While the core project requirements are essential, these projects are often well-polished, demonstrate a **strong attention to detail**, and solve **a unique societal problem**. In spirit of the rise of *AI-Education tools*, projects that incorporate AI-based learning platforms, simulations, teaching tools, or research tools will be given special consideration.

## Milestone 0: Project Setup and Proposal

### Accepting a Github Link as Group 

- Joining a group repository is slightly different than individual lab/repo. You must join or create a group before accepting the project. 
- It is recommended for the group project manager to accept the link first, create the group and then the rest of the group members can join the group.
  - Make sure to do this correctly, as you will not be able to change your group once you have accepted the project.
  - **The group names should be identical to the group names in Canvas (including the number and name**)

Here is an example of how to accept a group project. You notice group `G0` has already been created, so joining it is as simple as clicking the join button to the top right of the group name.

### Repository Visibility

- By default, all project repositories will be set as `private`, however, should you wish to make your repository `public`, you may submit a request to your TA.


**Deliverables:**
- Project Repository ([Accept Github Classroom Link + Join Your Group - Link TBA]) 
  - You're encouraged to refer to [this template](https://github.com/CMPT-276-SPRING-2025/CMPT-276-Project-Template) as a starting point for your project repository

    - You will only implement 6 features in the final project, the other 6 are for backup 
  - Write 1 user story for each feature you plan to implement  
  - A low-fidelity storyboard of the application interface/features
    - This should include the user flow and how the user will interact with the application 
    - This can be hand-drawn or developed using software tools ([list of tools available here](resources.md?id=design-tools))
  - Choose a [front-end technology stack](resources.md?id=languages-and-frameworks) that this project will be based on
    - Briefly explain why you chose this stack

<summary>Milestone 1.5 details (click to expand):</summary>

This project check-in is an opportunity for your group to receive feedback on the progress of your project and ensure that you are on track to complete the project successfully. 

The check-in will be a 15-minute meeting with your assigned TA. As we approach the check-in date, groups will be provided with a sign-up sheet to select a time slot for their meeting (on a first-come, first-serve basis).

To prepare for this check-in, your group should submit a 1-page report that includes the group's progress on the following items:


|         Item          |                          Expected Progress                          |
| :-------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    API 1 features     |           Features should be completed or near completion           |
|    API 2 features     |           Features details should be confirmed and planned           |
| Application Interface |  Interface should be developed and interactive with API 1 features  |
|         CI/CD         |              Pipeline should be set up and configured               |
|  Application Testing  | Automated tests should be set up and configured for API 1 features |


> **All group members are required to attend this check-in. Any member who fails to attend will receive a `10% deduction` from their individual project grade. Individuals who arrive late will also be subject to a penalty of `1%` per minute. No exceptions will be made.**
