## Slack

This term we will be using a [Slack](https://cmpt276-summer2025.slack.com) for all class discussions, including assignment clarifications. Please join the Slack workspace using your SFU student email address (link available on Canvas admin module). Please direct all course-related questions to the Slack workspace (#help channel). For personal matters, please use email. 

> Please do NOT send messages via the Canvas messaging system. The Canvas messaging system is not a communication avenue used in the course, and messages sent here may not be seen/responded to until much later.

## Professionalism 

Students are expected to maintain a high level of professionalism in all course activities and communication with the instructor and peers. This includes proper email etiquette, respectful communication in class, and adherence to deadlines. Before sending an email, please ensure that you have included a subject line including the course code (CMPT 276), a greeting, a clear message, **your full name/student ID#** and a closing. Using AI/ChatGPT to generate emails/slack messages is **not recommended** and **such emails will be returned for revision.**

Before sending an email, make sure to review this article on [email etiquette](email-etiquette.md) and/or [How To Email Your Professor](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~ilaba/teaching/email.html) for tips on how to effectively communicate with your instructor. **Emails that do not follow these guidelines will be returned to the sender for revision.**

> Repeated unprofessional behavior will result in grade deduction from your final grade, with **each violation resulting in a 1% deduction**. Students will be notified of possible deductions after the first official warning.
