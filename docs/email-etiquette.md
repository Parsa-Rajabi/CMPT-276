Dear Reader,

Whether you have never emailed your instructors before or already consider yourself an email guru, we’ve got some tips to help you maintain effective—and professional—correspondence.

## Before You Send Your Email

Ask yourself, **“What am I trying to achieve by sending this email?”** Emails flood your instructor’s inbox every day—so make sure you've tried looking for the answer yourself first. For instance, is your query related to:

- **Course logistics?** Consult the syllabus.
- **Missed class?** Connect with a friend for what you missed.
- **Homework help?** Try resources (like Piazza) first. If you still need help, consider waiting until your instructor’s office hours.
- **In-depth questions or a long discussion?** Schedule a meeting instead.

**Pro Tip:** Run your email inquiry by a trusted friend for feedback.

## Choose a “Professional” Email Address

Avoid using addresses that might raise eyebrows (e.g., `shawnchangissocoolomg@example.com`). If you have a professional email, great! For an extra edge, use your respective university email (UBC examples (`cwl@student.ubc.ca`) to:

1. Show your clear connection to the university.
2. Avoid landing in your instructor’s spam folder.

## Crafting a Send-Worthy Email

### **1. Write an Informative, Concise Subject Line**
Include the course code/name/section and a summary of your email, e.g., 
- `MATH 100 101: Homework questions`
- `WRDS 150 202: Clarification about today’s lecture`

Avoid long subject lines that might be truncated with “...”.

### **2. Use the Proper Salutation and Honorific**

- **Salutation:** Prefer “Dear” over “Hi” or “Hey.”
- **Honorifics:**
  - Avoid `Mr.`/`Miss`/`Ms.`/`Mrs.`/`Mx.`
  - Use `Dr.` for PhD holders or `Professor` otherwise.
  - Follow their stated preference if mentioned in class.

### **3. Structure Your Email Content**

Run through what you want to communicate before drafting. Address everything upfront to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth. Use this structure:

- **a) Introduce yourself and your situation:** Mention your name, course, and section. Example: “I am writing to [specific purpose].”
- **b) Elaborate on the situation:** Be specific and use bold/italicized/underlined text sparingly. Include screenshots if helpful (after vetting them).
- **c) Include required actions:** Be clear about what you need from the instructor (e.g., feedback, meeting scheduling).
- **d) Add a polite closing:** Thank your instructor and include your name and student number.

### **4. Make Your Email Scannable**

If your email is long, make it more digestible by:
- Using block format (no indented paragraphs).
- Limiting sentences per paragraph.
- Using bullet points and numbered lists.

### **5. Review Your Email**

- Read it out loud to ensure clarity and formality.
- Check for grammar, spelling, and conciseness.
- Attach the correct files (if needed).

## Sending Your Email

- Send emails in the morning, if possible.
- Avoid weekends; emails sent on weekends may be buried by Monday.
- After sending, allow a few days for a response before following up.

### **Following Up**

- Send a concise follow-up if needed, e.g., “I would like to follow up on my previous email...” or “I was wondering if you had a chance to review my email from [date]...”
- For urgent matters, consider reaching out to the department head.

If you solve your issue while waiting, update your instructor to save their time.

## Responding to Replies

- Reply promptly and formally.
- If the response doesn’t address your question, rephrase or request a meeting.
- Match your tone to theirs but avoid casual responses unless explicitly encouraged.
