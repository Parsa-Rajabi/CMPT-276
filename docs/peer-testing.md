# Usability and Peer Testing Preparation Guide

## Introduction

This peer testing session is designed to help you gather real-world feedback on your application’s usability and functionality. You’ll act in two roles during the session: **Tester** and **Observer**. Each role provides unique perspective, allowing you to experience both perspectives of user testing. This session will help you gain a deeper understanding of your app's user experience, identify bugs, and discover potential improvements.

### Key Outcomes:
- Receive actionable feedback on your application’s usability and performance.
- Understand user expectations and refine the user experience.
- Identify and prioritize usability issues, bugs, and feature enhancements.

> [!WARNING]
> All students and group members are required to attend and actively engage in the peer testing session. Failure to do so will result in a 10% deduction from their individual project grade.

## Preparation

### Setting Up Tasks and Instructions

1. **Identify Testing Tasks**: Choose 3-5 specific tasks for testers. These should provide meaningful insight into your application’s functionality and usability. Since each tester will complete 1-2 tasks, focus on the tasks that are most relevant to the current development stage.

   Examples:  
   - Complete a login and navigation flow.
   - Add an item to the cart and proceed to checkout.
   - Search and filter data within the application.

2. **Prepare Instructions**: Create a document with clear, step-by-step instructions (bullet point is recommended) for each task. Avoid giving additional verbal guidance during the session to ensure a consistent experience for all testers. Include a brief written overview of the app’s purpose, user role, and the scenario your tester should follow.

3. **Create a Feedback Questionnaire**: Prepare a short feedback form for testers to fill out post-session, including:
   - General Impressions: Open-ended thoughts on the application.
   - Task-Specific Feedback: Questions on ease of use, any confusion, and issues encountered for each task.
   - Usability Suggestions: Ask for suggestions on navigation, design, or clarity improvements.

## During the Session

### Role 1: Observer

When you’re at your station, your role is to **observe** the tester’s interactions without intervening.

- **Project Setup**: Have your project running locally, and if possible, provide a live link to the application.
- **Provide Minimal Context**: Give the tester only the written task instructions and user role description. Try not to not offer additional guidance to ensure consistency.
- **Observe and Take Notes**:
  - Note areas where the tester completes tasks smoothly (successful), struggles (confusion) or encounters errors (bugs).


### Role 2: Tester

When you are the tester for another team’s application:

- **Follow Instructions Carefully**: Read and follow the provided task instructions step-by-step without asking for extra guidance. Try to complete tasks as the target user would, following any provided role-playing instructions.
- **Fill Out the Feedback Form**: After testing, complete the feedback form as fully and constructively as possible. Give the same level of detail you would want to receive for your application.

## After the Session

1. **Gather and Review Feedback**: After all testing sessions, gather your team to discuss and review the feedback received from testers.
  
2. **Prioritize and Create GitHub Issues**:
   - **Immediate Adjustments**: Minor tweaks that can be quickly implemented.
   - **Critical Issues**: Major issues that need to be addressed before project completion.
   - **Bug Reports**: Document issues with details on recreating, severity, and context.
   - **Feature Improvements**: List suggested features or improvements with rationale, labeled as "Future TODOs" if they are deferred.

3. **Next Steps**: Use the feedback and GitHub issues to create a roadmap of adjustments and improvements based on available time and resources.
