# Mini-Project 

The goal of this mini-project is to provide you with an opportunity to develop a website based on a similar technology stack that you will be using for your final project. To expand on your github skills and knowledge, you will also be deploying the website through Github Pages.

## Instructions
0. Accept the mini-project via [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/LtPf6cUH)
1. Watch the following video to learn more about Github Pages and deploying your website
   - [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/QyFcl_Fba-k?si=oH0L3BZo8h9x1Yby)
2. Come up with a simple website idea
   - I recommend using this opportunity to create a personal/portfolio website.
   - Refer to website rubric/requirements below for more details
3. Set up your website repository on Github (hint: the repo name should be `your-username.github.io`)
   - Refer to [Github's website](https://pages.github.com/) to learn more about the steps on how to accomplish this
4. Develop a wireframe of your website using a tool we discussed in class
   - You're encouraged to use similar tools that you'd be using for your project
   - Refer to resources below for guides on how to create a wireframe
5. Develop your website using your preferred technology stack
   - This could be a great opportunity to learn a new technology stack, to prepare for your class project
   - Refer to [resources page](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CMPT-276/#/resources) on canvas/course website for more information
6. Deploy with Github Pages
   - Refer to [Github's website](https://pages.github.com/) to learn more about the steps on how to accomplish this
7. Answer the follow-up questions included in the repository

## Requirements

Although this mini-project is open-ended, I highly recommend developing a personal website to add more projects to your portfolio which will be helpful for your future job applications.

Note: personal websites are _meant_ to be **personal**. Try to make it unique to you and only share information you're comfortable with. Due to privacy reasons, you can choose to develop another website that still meets the requirements of this mini-project. If you choose to develop another website, please consult with a TA to ensure it meets the requirements of this mini-project.

### Personal Website

Your personal website could include some of the following elements (these are just suggestions)

- Short bio about who you are + picture
- List of your previous/current projects + links to github repo
- Programming skills and frameworks you're comfortable with (could be combined with the item above)
- Link to professional social media i.e. LinkedIn, Github etc.
- Work experience
- Volunteer experience
- Education
- What youâ€™re passionate about (personal hobbies, interests, etc.)
- Link to resume/CV
- Any other information you'd like to share

## Not sure where to start?

In case you're not sure where to start, I recommend checking out [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j) module that wll guide you on web dev basics such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. While most of the content is locked for "subscribers", as a Github student developer, [Scrimba offers a free subscription for 1 month](https://scrimba.helpscoutdocs.com/article/19-do-you-offer-student-discounts). 

You are not expected to complete the module as part of this mini-project, but it could be a great resource to get you started on web development.

## Website Rubric

- `[17 marks total]` Website Elements (refer to below for more details)
- `[17 marks total]` Github items (refer to below for more details)

### Website Elements 

- `[5 marks]` Website's wireframe is organize, easy to understand and the provided description matches the wireframe 
- `[1 mark]` Website includes a bio/overview
- `[1.5 marks (0.25 each)]` Website includes at least 6 hyperlinks to external websites
- `[5 marks]` Website adheres to all 10 usability heuristics (Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics)
- `[1 mark]` Website has a custom [favicon](https://favicon.io/tutorials/what-is-a-favicon/)
- `[1.5 marks (0.5 mark each)]` Website has at least 3 separate sections/tabs with information
- `[1.5 marks (0.5 mark each)]` Website has at least 3 images with appropriate alt text
- `[0.5 mark]` Website content is engaging and free of spelling/grammar errors

#### Out of Scope

While this is a great opportunity to learn new technologies, please note that the following are out of scope for this mini-project:

- Responsive design (your website should be accessible on a desktop browser only) e.g. no mobile or tablet support
- SEO optimization
- Web analytics
- Custom domain
- Database integration
- User authentication
- Server-side scripting
- Any other advanced features that are not covered in this course

#### Acceptable Technologies for this Mini-Project

I encourage you to use this opportunity to modify existing templates, frameworks, and libraries to make your website development process easier/faster. Refer to our [resources page](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CMPT-276/#/resources) for more information. 

### Github Items 

- `[10 marks (1 mark each)]` Write, complete and merge at least 10 github issues using branches and pull requests. These issues must have:
   - Description of the issue, including acceptance criteria or definition of what "done" means
   - Assignees (you can assign yourself)
   - Labels (Create at least 3 new labels for your repo)
   - Milestone (Create a `milestone` for your git repo and use it in your github issues)
   - Project (Create a github project via the `Projects` tab on your repo and use it in your github issues)
- `[1 mark]` Git repo has a License associated with it (MIT, Apache, etc.) and you've provided an explanation of why you chose that license
- `[6 marks]` Website is deployed and accessible with Github Pages

### Github Etiquette

As you work on your mini-project, you should be making regular commits to your website repository. Each commit should have a meaningful message that describes what you did. You are graded on your use of git, including commit messages. Commit messages that do not provide a meaningful description of the changes made will result in a deduction of `1%` marks, each. 

For this mini-project, we expect to see a minimum of `30 meaningful commits` (total) to the website repository (on average, this translates to ~3 commits per each issue/branch). You should break up your work into small, manageable tasks and commit your changes as you complete each task. Repositories with less than the specified number of commits will be penalized with a deduction of `1%` for each missing commit.
