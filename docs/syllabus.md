## Course Format 

- **Tuesdays 1:30-2:20 PM - SYRE 2016 (Surrey)**
- **Thursdays 12:30-2:20 PM - Asynchronous, Flipped Classroom (No live session)**

Lectures will be held **in-person** on Tuesdays from 1:30-2:20pm in SYRE 2016. Thursday session will be dedicated to asynchronous activities such as lecture recordings, assigned readings, videos, labs, and project work (**there will be no live lectures**). Students are expected to attend all live lectures on Tuesdays and participate in all course activities to succeed in the course.

### Flipped Classroom

This course will be taught using a pedagogical technique known as the [Flipped classroom](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/flipped-classrooms). This approach makes the most of our precious class time by eliminating the standard lecturing model, where course material is introduced to the students during class, usually via a lengthy PowerPoint presentation.  In our Flipped classroom, you will come to class having already completed several pre-assigned material (and videos) where you will be introduced to the course material.  During class, you will apply your understanding of these core concepts through carefully-chosen problems and activities, which will enable you to solidify your knowledge.  

Flipped classrooms require much more focus and preparation time, for both the instructor and the students.  After all, it is much easier for the instructor to read a set of pre-prepared slides and for the students to passively observe and listen.  But in our class, we will devote our class time to the computational thinking process: resolving obstacles, developing conceptual understanding and communicating solutions supported by evidence. Through this process, you will better develop your confidence, creativity, and critical-thinking skills (i.e. Computational Thinking), preparing you to become a successful problem-solver in the real world.

In order for this course to be a meaningful learning experience, you will need to come to each class well-prepared, with all assigned modules and videos complete. This emphasis on assigned lecture recordings and labs is the reason why the course is structured as it is. If you do not complete the modules, you will have a hard time following the in-class activities, which will make it that much harder for you to successfully complete the course deliverables.

I have designed this course so that you will be spending approximately 8 to 10 hours per week on all activities relating to this course (i.e., labs, projects, attending class, etc.). If you find that you are spending significantly more time than this, please let me know. I am always happy to help you manage your time more effectively.

## Course Evaluation

|   **Item**    | **Weight** |
| :-----------: | :--------: |
|     Labs      |    10%     |
|    Midterm    |    25%     |
| Mini-project  |     5%     |
| Final Project |    30%     |
|  Final Exam   |    30%     |

The maximum score for each course component is 100%. The final grade will be calculated based on the weighted average of the components.

*Do not schedule travel or other commitments during the final exam period. Final exam dates are set by the university and are not flexible.*

- [Professionalism](/teaching-team?id=professionalism) is expected at all times. This includes respectful communication with your peers and instructors, as well as timely responses to teaching team emails (e.g. within 2 business days) and participation in group work. Students who do not meet the standards of professionalism will be subject to penalties (e.g. final grade deductions).

### Passing Criteria

- Students must attain the following in order to obtain a clear pass (C- or better) in the course:
  - A passing grade (>50%) on the weighted average of the exams (midterm and final)
  - A passing grade (>50%) on the weighted average of the project (mini and final)

## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. This grade is calculated based on peer evaluations received from your team members, as well as the quality of your contributions to the project. Completing detailed and thoughtful peer evaluations also contributes to your grade.

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:

1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally based on the group's agreed-upon terms in the group contract. This includes documenting these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with their TA. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the TA will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the TA.
3.	**TA Intervention**: Following the consultation, the TA may involve other teaching team members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all group members. If additional actions are needed, the teaching team will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.**

## Course and SFU Policies
---
### Late Deliverables 

All course items (e.g. labs, projects, etc.) have a specific due date and time. Your work is late if it is not turned in by the deadline. Labs can be submitted up to 24 hours after the due date with a 25% penalty. After 24 hours, the submission will not be accepted and a score of zero will be assigned. 

Exams (including the midterm and final) and course project are fixed and cannot be deferred. If you miss an exam, you will receive a score of zero (no exceptions). Project submissions must be made on time, and late submissions will not be accepted.

Make-up assessments (including assignments, project, exams) will not be given. Sometimes life gets in the way of schedules. Sickness or other unplanned or extraordinary events happen and will be dealt with individually. It is your responsibility to ensure your situation is known to the instructor as soon as reasonably possible. You are accountable for being heard, which means you need to ensure that the instructor heard you.
 
While "life happens," poor planning by you does not count. And definitely do not wait to discuss gray areas. For example, an interview opportunity arises (good!): you should not wait until the day before the assignment is due to let us know that you could not complete the assignment because you had to prepare for the interview. That would be considered poor planning. Good planning would be to alert the TA or Instructor that you got the interview and, while you hope to finish the assignment, there is a concern. Then when you don’t finish on time, it’s clear that you planned your time and that will be taken into consideration. These "good planning" situations will be considered individually as per the instructor's discretion.

In all cases, exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate and verified documentation. Refer to accommodations and concessions section below for more details.

### Missed Deliverables

All course content must be submitted on Canvas via the [assignment tab](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/88205/assignments). Not submitting on Canvas will be considered as a missed submission and the following penalties will be applied:

- 1st instance penalty = -5%
- 2nd instance penalty = -15%
- 3rd instance penalty (and onwards) = -25%

Students who do not submit on Canvas will be assigned a grade of 0 until they reach out to their TA with the correct submission, within 7 calendar days of the deadline. No missed canvas submission will be accepted after 7 calendar days of the deadline. This is not to be confused with the late submission policy, which is outlined above.

### Classroom Etiquette

The classroom principles that we will follow in the classroom are transparency, equity and inclusion, participation, active dialog, and constructive critique. Students are expected to support each other, learn from each other, and help each other grow. Students have the responsibility to conduct themselves in ways that will help them learn, yet that will not disrupt other students’ learning. While each student will be working closely with their team members, you are also expected to engage with your classmates in a respectful, kind, and helpful manner.

In the class, we encourage asking questions, sharing ideas, and engaging in discussions related to the class topics. Sometimes discussions may steer away from the course content, and the course instructor will reserve the right to re-direct it back on track.

Giving and receiving feedback is one of the core activities in this class. When giving and receiving feedback, it is important to keep in mind that we give feedback because we want all projects to succeed. Our feedback will highlight parts that work well but also point out aspects that can be improved. The feedback should not be taken personally or seen as an attack on students' knowledge or capabilities. Thus, we will learn a craft of constructive feedback and practice it in the class regularly.

---
### Project/Lab Policy

- You may not send the instructor or the TAs draft project/labs for feedback – post all questions to Slack so that everyone can benefit from the answers
- labs/projects may be shared/shown in class and online (with no student name/ID). Students will be contacted ahead 
---
### Remarking Policy

As a teaching team, we strive to provide fair and accurate assessments of your work while also providing as much feedback. We encourage you to review the feedback and spend your time/energy where it serves you the most which will be learning from past mistakes and self-improvement. While you reserve your right to ask for a re-grade, we find debating grades an incredible drain on course staff time and energy and prevents us from serving students well and focusing on most important aspects of the course. Regrade requests are not an avenue for you to argue or debate about the grading scheme. Regrade requests are meant as a way for you to let us know about situations where the grading scheme may not have been correctly applied to your work.

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and feedback/comments (if applicable).
2. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
3. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written letter for the re-marking and be submitted to the course TA/instructor within 5 business days from receiving the mark or a deadline specified by the TA/instructor, whichever comes first. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

> [!WARNING]
> Course grades are considered final on a rolling basis (e.g. as we progress through the semester). After the regrading request deadline (e.g., 5 business days or deadline set by TA/instructor), grades will be considered final and no further requests will be accepted. Students are encouraged to review their grades and ask questions within the specified time frame. Inquiries after the deadline will not be considered.

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the teaching team and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final. 

Each student may submit two remarking request for the term.

## Grade Solicitation Policy

Requests for grade adjustments (especially final course grade) based on non-academic reasons are not appropriate and are considered unprofessional. Examples include, but are not limited to, statements such as "I need this grade," "I deserve a higher grade" or any similar personal circumstances.

Students are expected to meet the academic requirements of the course as outlined in this syllabus. Soliciting grade changes undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and may result in a negative impact on your final grade.

If you have concerns about your performance, you are encouraged to seek feedback early and make use of available resources, such as office hours and course support services, to address any challenges proactively.

### SFU Student Code of Conduct

The [S 10.05 Student Conduct Policy](https://www.sfu.ca/students/studentconduct/policy.html) defines students' basic responsibilities as academic community members, defines inappropriate student conduct, and provides procedures and outcomes to be invoked if students engage in such behaviour.

### SFU Academic Integrity

Education is about shaping your identity as much as it is about learning concepts and skills. In school, the consequences of making mistakes are relatively small. But the habits you form now—repeated over days, weeks, months, or years—will determine who you become in the future. While taking shortcuts now may seem relatively harmless and easily justified, doing so runs the risk of developing bad habits that will make it difficult for you to act more earnestly or honestly in the future when the stakes are higher and the consequences are more severe.

Academic honesty reflects the trust (or the lack thereof) between students and teachers. We have worked hard to design this course in ways that engender trust and that encourage honest and earnest behavior. We hope that, when you are struggling, you will take advantage of the resources and policies that we have provided (e.g. consulting course resources, posting on the message board, attending office hours) rather than resorting to dishonest conduct.

The [S10.01 Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html) is based on the six core values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage. It is expected that all students abide by this policy for this and all courses at SFU. Want to learn more about Academic Integrity at SFU? Visit the [SFU Academic Integrity Tutorial](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/56136).

Note: Much of the language above regarding academic integrity was borrowed/adapted from Kevin Lin.

### Accommodations and Concessions

Simon Fraser University acknowledges and affirms the rights of students with disabilities to have equal access to the university and to be welcomed as fully participating members of the university community. The [Centre for Accessibility Learning (CAL)](https://www.sfu.ca/students/accessible-learning.html) provides support and advocacy for students with disabilities. Their primary responsibility is determining reasonable academic accommodations for students with documented disabilities. 

Accommodations and Concessions are two different aspects of student support.

Accommodation refers to special arrangement of learning due to known and documented conditions (e.g., extra time during an exam due to a medical documented medical and/or learning situation). If you believe you are legally entitled for an accommodation, consult with [FAS Advising](https://www.sfu.ca/fas/current-student/advising.html), [Centre for Accessibility Learning](https://www.sfu.ca/students/accessible-learning.html), [Health and Counselling](https://www.sfu.ca/students/health/), and/or the [Human Rights Office](http://www.sfu.ca/humanrights.html).

Concession refers to special arrangement (usually one-time) due to unexpected situations or circumstances preventing students from participating in course-related activities. Typically a doctor's note is required to justify a concession, however, this academic year SFU and the FAS faculty have indicated that a [self-declaration form](https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/students/academicsuccess/academicconcessions/2021%20SFU_AcademicConcession_SelfDeclarationForm.pdf) would be sufficient for minor absences. Major absences will require a doctor's note and/or a [certification of illness form](https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/students/pdf/certificate-of-illness.pdf). 

If you believe you are entitled for a concession, **contact the instructor first**. Whether the request is granted or not is subject to the SFU and FAS Faculty policies and regulations, **and also to the instructor's discretion**. Requests must be submitted before the due date of the activities in question or as soon as the situation permits. Refer to [this Academic Concessions article](https://www.sfu.ca/students/academic-success/academic-concessions.html) for details.

### Additional Student Support

A variety of student well-being resources are available through [SFU Student Services Health and Counselling](http://www.sfu.ca/students/health/). In addition to utilizing these, please feel free to contact me with regards to course-specific issues of concern.

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, depression, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. SFU offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, consider utilizing the confidential mental health services available on campus. We encourage you to reach out to the Counseling Center for support.

### SFU COVID-19 Protocols (last update 4 Jan, 2023)

Based on the Order of the Provincial Health Officer, SFU has suggested a few guidelines for teaching activities. Here are some of the important ones:

- Marks are no longer required and will be a personal choice. If you forget your mask and want one, disposable masks are available from Student Central in Burnaby and at the information desks in Vancouver and Surrey.
- You are encouraged to get vaccinated. There are vaccination clinics on both Burnaby and Surrey campuses.
- Stay home, get tested, and notify the instructor if you feel sick or are experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms -- we'll work it out.
- Be respectful to others. People have different comfort levels and are going through things at their own pace. You never know what someone else is dealing with.
- For more details refer to [SFU FAS COVID-19 Protocols](https://www.sfu.ca/fas/safety/cdp.html#:~:text=Illness%20and%20Academic%20Concessions,recommended%20by%20the%20BC%20CDC.).
